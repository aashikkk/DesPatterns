## Model/ View / Controller

Aim of MVC is decouple the things. 

**Model**
* Holds data & manipulates it.
  * Ex: Student Object holds name,marks & etc -- Like a DB

**View**
* Screeen presentation
  * Ex: Pie chart, Bar chart 

**Controller**
* Act as a mediator between Model and View
* Defines the way the user interface(UI) reacts to the user.
